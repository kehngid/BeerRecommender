Creating recommender systems using BeerAdvocate data

Below is a link to where I got dataset:
https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#multi_aspect
It is not avaiable on the repo because the file is to large

I also am in the process of reading papers about recommender systems, those are located in the paper folder.
Here is the github repo where I found some:
